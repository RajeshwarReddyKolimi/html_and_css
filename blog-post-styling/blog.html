          Cricket is a much-loved sport across the globe, especially in India.
          Cricket is all-encompassing whether you're watching it live on the
          ground or on television. We cricket fans enjoy every moment and aspect
          of the game, and the sport has kept us glued to our seats from the
          beginning till the end of the game.

          During a World Cup game, different generations of the family come
          together and enjoy the game. Each generation has its way of
          celebrating or deciding during the intense part of the game,
          interpreting it, and much more. The game hasn't changed much in these
          years, but the tech used in the game is evolving and has made the game
          much more interesting.

          Technology in cricket has been evolving, and these enhancements in
          tech have impacted the game and its decisions. Technology has been a
          boon for cricket and has significantly impacted the game in several
          ways. From player fitness, broadcasting, and equipment to coaching,
          every element of the game is now tech-enabled.

            Some of the ways in which technology has affected cricket include:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Improved Equipment:</strong> Materials science and
                manufacturing advances have led to better cricket equipment,
                such as lighter and stronger bats and protective gear.
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Smart bails</strong>
                    have a microsensor and lights inside them which lights up
                    when the ball hits the wickets or the bails. This tech has
                    been a reliever to everyone from viewers to umpires to the
                    players.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Stump mic with camera</strong>
                    which records video and audio on the front and back of the
                    wicket. It has been a boon for the umpires in making their
                    decision.
                  </p>
                </li>

              <p>
                <strong>Enhanced broadcasting and coverage: </strong>
                Technology has also transformed how cricket is broadcast and
                covered by the media. Television coverage has become much more
                sophisticated, using multiple camera angles, slow-motion
                replays, and interactive graphics.
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    More advancements have been made in terms of broadcasting
                    where you can see the <strong>Spidercam</strong> as a
                    technology that has been rewarding for viewers and
                    decision-makers in the game. It gives us a different
                    perspective of the match as viewers and also gives multiple
                    angles making sure the in-match decisions are taken
                    accurately.

                <strong>PitchVision:</strong> This technology helps the bowlers
                to know their ball length, pitching areas and leg position while
                bowling. It was introduced in 2007 and has been a helping hand
                for bowlers to improve upon.

                <strong> Decision Review System (DRS): </strong>
                The DRS is a system that allows teams to challenge the on-field
                umpire's decision using technology such as Hawk-Eye, which uses
                multiple cameras to track the path of the ball and determine
                whether it would have hit the stumps.

                    <strong>Snickometer</strong>
                    also called Snicko was introduced in 1990 and was one of the
                    first technological advancements that changed the game by
                    giving the third umpires an extra edge over their decisions.

                <strong> Increased fan engagement: </strong>
                Technology has also helped to increase fan engagement with
                cricket. For example, fans can now access live scores, stats,
                and other information about their favorite teams and players
                through websites and mobile apps. Fans can also contest in a
                live contest and winners will be featured on live television and
                on the stadium screens.

                <strong> Analysis and training: </strong> Technology has also
                been used to help players improve their performance on the
                field. For example, players can use wearable technology to track
                their physical fitness and training progress, and coaches can
                use video analysis software to identify areas for improvement.
