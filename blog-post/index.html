    <h2>What is chess?</h2>
    <p>
      Chess is a 2 player board game consisting of 64 squares with alternate
      colours (black and white). Each player has 16 pieces of which 8 pawns, 2
      rooks, 2 bishops, 2 knights, a queen and a king. Each player takes
      alternate turns starting from white. The goal of the game is to checkmate
      the opponent king which simply means making him immobile while in check.
